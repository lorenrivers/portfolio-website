          Based in Cambridgeshire, I&apos;ve discovered a love for coding over
          the last year. My aspirations are to continue to develop my skills in
          this area and create professional web applications that have great
          user experiences.
        </p>
        <p className="px-10 pb-5">
          When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy sewing and would love to get back
          into learning dressmaking again! I&apos;m also a huge F1 fan and enjoy
          going to gym regularly.
